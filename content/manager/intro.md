Cloudify provides a method for provisioning applications using Cloudify blueprints and allows utilizing workflows and plugins. While this is useful, managing the application post-deployment requires a lot more and this is where Cloudify Manager comes in to play.

Cloudify Manager allows users to manage multiple applications deployed via multiple blueprints, executing different workflows on those applications independently and viewing application related information like the application's topology, logs and metrics using a web interface and much more.
