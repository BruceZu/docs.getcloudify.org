The Blueprint Composer is a graphical editor for creating blueprint YAML files dynamically using
a modern Drag and Drop Interface, including network items, custom types and inline types and
custom plugins and interfaces. The composer enables topology modeling for complex
applications while providing means to add relevant lifecycle operations implementation via
external plugins and scripts. The end result will be a downloadable file generated by the
composer which will provide a TOSCA based description for the application topology and
lifecycle management.
This guide will quickly walk you through the use of the Composer.
